As ISO20022 adoption is kicking off in 2020 and will go through till 2025, we will see increased demand in understanding whether an ISO 20022 XML file is as per the schema definition (XSD file).

Therefore this simple tool should allow you to upload your XML file (data) & the corresponing XSD (schema) and get a simple answer : Is the file valid or not valid?
